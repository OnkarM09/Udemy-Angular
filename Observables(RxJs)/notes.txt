What is an observable?
Observable can be thought as data source.
In Anbular we import the Observable from third party package called as RxJs.
The observable here is implmeneted in such way that if follows Observale and we can have observer.
In between them we have a stream of timeline and in this timeline we can have multiple events emitted by the observable, we can call it data package emitted by the observable

Operators
So we have obsersvable and then observer who listens to that data.
So what does operator do?
You can use build in opertaots After observable and before observer
Observable -> Operators -> Observer
So will now subscribe to the result of operator instead of observable directly.

Subject
What is subject?
So subject is an special type of observable which is active
So when to use subject, for example when user is continuesly emitting data there we should use subject. (Cross component communication using service)
Subject is an alternative to the event emitter
Unssubscribe your subject on destroy.
