Temeplate driven forms gives features more in HTML 
To use it import FormsModule into ngModule.
Add HTML Form element in your html code for and if we need control form in TS file then we will use local reference using # and in ts file,
for ex: 
<form #sampleForm="ngForm">
	your form content
</form>


in TS file,
@ViewChild('sampleForm') sampleForm : ngForm;

and now we can use form methods using this.

to submit for we have to use submit form in the form elmeent itself rather than submiting the form on button click,
<form (ngSubmit)="submitForm()"></form>

in TS file,
submitForm(){
	console.log("form has been submitted");
	
}
